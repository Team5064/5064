<p>Students are required to cooperate at all times. This means that if a mentor asks a student to perform a specific task, the student is required to comply with the best of his or her ability. Ignoring the directions or requests of a mentor is not in the teamâ€™s best interest. If you feel a request is out of order, you are encouraged to first talk to the mentor and, if this does not resolve the conflict, bring the matter to the attention of the Management Team or Team Director. The Management Team or Team Director makes the final decision not the student or the mentor.</p>
