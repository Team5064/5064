<p>Our team uniform is our team t-shirts. These shirts are designed by the team and worn on competition days. These shirts will also be worn by every team member (students and mentors) at all official functions in which the team participates. When participating in official team functions no clothing is permitted to be worn on top of the t-shirt covering it up unless approved by the Management Team or the Team Director. The team shirts may not be altered or worn in any manner not approved by the Management Team or the Team Director. The only approved modification to the t-shirts is the attachment of official <em>FIRST</em> swag, i.e. buttons, lapel pins etc. from other teams or from affiliated organizations (e.g. <em>FIRST</em>) or sponsors. Students and mentors on the team receive one t-shirt per season. The t-shirt is to be taken care of and maintained.</p>
 
<p>If team members are not wearing their team t-shirt on designated days they will be asked to change clothes (which may involve having to go back home to pick up the t-shirt).</p>
