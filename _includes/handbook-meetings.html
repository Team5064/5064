<p>Most of our team meetings take place in our head quarters <a href="http://progressiveacademy.ca/">Progressive Academy</a>. Students and mentors are guests at Progressive Academy and need to be courteous, clean, and respectful. Remember to pick up any food or drink containers that you have used and deposit them in the proper location or recycle bin. Our meeting locations are classrooms that are used students and teachers every day. It must be clean and ready for the next dayâ€™s class before anyone leaves at the end of team meetings. This includes sweeping and/or vacuum the floor if any work creating debris has been conducted (e.g. saw dust or metal filings, etc.). When working with school equipment, treat it with care. All students, mentors and visitors must always wear safety apparel and follow safety guidelines when working. Closed toed shoes and safety glasses are always a must and long hair has to be tied back.</p>
