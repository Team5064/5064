<p>Outside of meetings the team communicates using our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/opcomrobotics/">Facebook group web page</a>. All students and mentors are required to have an active Facebook account, to be members of the FRC 5064 Facebook group, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/opcomrobotics/">www.facebook.com/groups/opcomrobotics/</a> and to actively and regularly check the group page. This form of communication is by far the fastest and most efficient mode of communication. </p>
