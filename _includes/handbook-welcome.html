<p>Welcome to <em>FIRST</em> Robotics Competition (FRC) Team 5064. Our team was founded in the fall of 2013 and we participated in our first competition, the Western Canada FRC Regional in April 2014. Over the course of our first season we have matured as a team and have started to build a solid foundation on which to continue our grow and success.</p>

<p>The path to the regional competition is not easy; it involves many hours of hard work by all the team members, students and mentors alike, during the whole year. By overcoming challenges and discovering solutions to problems that seems impossible to accomplish in the six week build period, under the guidance of our mentors, students develop many 21st century competencies that are important for success later in life, including collaboration and leadership, critical thinking and problem solving, creativity and innovation, social responsibility, communication, digital literacy, life long learning, self-direction and personal management. During the year students on our team are engaged with everything from close tied teamwork, the setting of milestones and evaluation of progress, time management, fabrication, electronics, programming, CAD production, video and photo editing, website and digital design, graphical design, fundraising, business management and much more. Participating in our team is a hands-on real world learning experience preparing students to become the next generation of innovators and thinkers. </p>
 
<p>The purpose of this handbook is to describe the expectations and rules students and mentors are required to follow as part of Team 5064. If you or your child is interested in joining us read this handbook carefully and ask yourself and your child if you are able to commit to the team, adhere to the rules and put in the time and hard work that is required. If you have any questions that are not answered in the handbook do not hesitate to <a href="{{ site.url }}/contact/">contact us</a>. The same applies if you are a prospective mentor. As a mentor you are required to follow the same rules as the students with the key difference that you will be held to even higher standards.</p>
