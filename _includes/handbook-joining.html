<p>Mentors are required to abide by all the expectations and rules described in this handbook and must submit a Police Criminal Record Check including Vulnerable Sector check in a timely fashion. While specific expertise is desirable (e.g. mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, programming, CAD, business management, CAD, graphical design, fundraising, etc.) expertise alone does not guarantee that a person would be a suitable mentor. The most important qualities the mentors has to bring to the team (much more important than technical expertise) is an ability to connect with, mentor and teach high school students, being a exemplary role model for children and youth, being willing and able to follow all the rules set forth in this guidelines, the <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/mentoring"><em>FIRST</em> mentor guidelines</a> and live up to and support the <em>FIRST</em> Core Values.</p>
