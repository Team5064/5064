<p>The behaviour of the team memberâ€™s is under scrutiny at all times. Students and mentors represent not only our team, but each and every community supporter, mentor, and sponsor. The behaviour of team members (students and mentors) is a message to all regarding the calibre of our team and its members. All members on the team (mentors and students) are required to follow the rules set forth in the Team Handbook, the <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/mission/corevalues">FIRST Core Values</a> and display mature and responsible behaviours at all times and in particular during meetings and official team functions, e.g. meeting with sponsors, outreach, competitions, field trips, etc. The Management Team and Team Director reserve the right to discipline any team member for not exhibiting appropriate behaviours. Disciplinary actions may including giving demerits or being sent home for the day as necessary for safety and the overall good of the team. For students the parents will be informed of any disciplinary actions as soon as possible.</p>
