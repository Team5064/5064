{% include h4.html txt="Mentors" id="mentors" %}
<p>Mentoring is a rewarding experience enabling adults to collaborate and help students achieve their full potential as well as experience many of the same challenges the students are facing. Mentors can provide a wide range of different help to students, e.g. technical training, organisational training (planning, financial, etc.) or general support (keep students on track, track goals, preparing meals, chaperoning, etc.). Mentors share their expertise, skills and enthusiasm with the students in the team. Through the students mentors are the key ingredient in the success of our team. Mentors report to the Management Team and the Team Director.</p>

{% include h4.html txt="Student members" id="studentmembers" %}
<p>All students are part of multiple sub-teams and report to the corresponding Team Captains.</p>

{% include h4.html txt="Parents" id="parents" %}
<p>Parents/guardians are an integral part of the team and important to our success. The team becomes a family throughout the year because the members spend a lot of time together. The students learn about hard work, perseverance, commitment, patience, joy, defeat, computer skills, respect, engineering, writing, interviewing, business skills, money management, marketing, production, publishing, kindness, time management, and most importantly, gracious professionalism. Having the involvement of their parents will only enhance this experience for them. Some things 
the team needs from parents include:
<ul>
<li>Providing timely transport for their student to/from team events and community services (this may include car-pooling.</li>
<li>Assisting and supporting their student in fundraising, outreach and community service activities.</li>
<li>Providing accurate medical information for their student, and keeping the Management Team and/or Team Director informed of any changes.</li>
<li>Participating in any team activities - it really helps to have parents present at these events! Parents are frequently needed to transport the robot(s) and students to and from outreach events, to provide adult supervision, etc.</li>
<li>Chaperoning team trips. </li>
<li>Helping your student organize an event or activity.</li>
<li>Mentoring.</li>
<li>Sponsorship.</li>
<li>Administrative duties (preparing meals, awards submission, marketing, PR, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Any and all support that can be provided by parents and the students' families is welcome. Every person has unique attributes that can be put to use for the good of our team. NEMO (Non-Engineering Mentor Organization, <a href="http://www.firstnemo.org">www.firstnemo.org</a>) helps parents volunteer with <em>FIRST</em> even if they’re not involved with the robot. NEMO has a list that shows <a href="http://www.firstnemo.org/PDF/101_ways_parents_can_help.pdf">101 ways that parents can help a <em>FIRST</em> team</a>.</p>
