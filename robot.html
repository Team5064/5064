title: "Meet our 2014 bot, Vlad the Impaler"

---
<p>This is our robot Vlad the Impaler. Vlad was designed to play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxp4dkMQ1Vo">the game Aerial Assist</a> which requires him to shoot a two foot yoga ball into a seven foot tall goal or push it into a goal at ground level. He is also a team player and is able to pass the ball to other robots on his team. To allow him to move fast while having weight to take hits and bash into other robots we have balanced his weight and speed.</p>

<dt>Frame and Drive</dt>
<dd>Vlad’s drive train is located in a square base (28" x 28") with a launcher cage mounted on top making him just under 4 feet tall. Four drive motors power six wheels allowing Vlad to reach speeds of 20 km/h.</dd>
<br \>

<dt>Launch and Load</dt>
<dd>At the front of Vlad is a set of arms connected to a motor which spins them up and down. To control this motion we use a magnet sensor to keep track of what position the arms are in. Once a ball is loaded onto the arms they spin up placing the ball inside the cage. This cage is able to tilt allowing us to aim the ball prior to launch. The launching mechanism consists of two pneumatic pistons that push down two metal leavers launching the ball out of the cage.</dd> 
<br \>

<dt>Pneumatics</dt>
<dd>The pneumatics are used for firing the ball and are powered by air pressure generated by an on-board compressor. The compressed air is used by three pneumatic pistons, one controlling a firing pin and the other two controlling the launcher arms.</dd> 
<br \>

<dt>Electronics</dt>
<dd>Vlad’s brain is a cRIO microprocessor. Connected to this processing unit is a digital motor controller, an analog input to collect data from sensors, and a relay module to control the pneumatic systems. We used a variety of motor controllers for controlling the pneumatics, driver motors and the motors controlling the tilting and lifting operations of the launch cage and arms. To distribute the power from the battery and to limit it to a safe voltage all of the electronics are connected to a Power Distribution Board.</dd>
