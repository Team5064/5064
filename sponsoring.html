<p>Team 5064 is funded by private donations and public fundraisers and we would not be able to do the work we do without the generous support of these donations. The team represents our sponsors in a positive light during presentations to students, companies, clubs, and through our media.</p>

<p>The team uses the money we so generously receive in a variety of ways. Registering for competitions, transportation to events, new tools, and robot parts are our main team expenses. We reward these sponsors in a variety of ways including:</p>
